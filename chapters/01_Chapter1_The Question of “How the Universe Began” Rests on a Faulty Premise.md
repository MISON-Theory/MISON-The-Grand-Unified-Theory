# Chapter 1: The Question of “How the Universe Began” Rests on a Faulty Premise

## Section 1: The Dead End of Infinite Regress

“When did the universe begin?”

At first glance, this question sounds scientific and deeply fundamental.  
Textbooks tell us that the Big Bang was the origin of the universe, so it feels natural to wonder what may have existed before it. But before diving in, we must acknowledge something important.

When we ask about “the beginning of the universe,” we are unconsciously assuming a major premise:  

**Time has existed from the very beginning.**  
**Time flows independently of the universe.**  
**Time exists like a container, and the universe began within it.**

These assumptions are taken for granted—but they hide a serious pitfall.

If time exists absolutely, and the universe “began at a certain moment,” then questions immediately arise:

- Why that moment?
- Why not earlier?
- Why not later?
- What was the state before that?
- And before that?

This instantly leads to an infinite regress.  
Human intuition insists that “every event must have a cause, and that cause must also have a cause,” which traps us in a deceptive logical loop.  
To explore the true origin of the universe, we must challenge this intuition itself.



## Section 2: The Existence of Time Is Not Self-Evident

Modern physics—especially relativity—undermines the above assumptions.

- The flow of time differs depending on the observer.
- Gravity changes the rate at which clocks tick.
- Time slows down as one approaches the speed of light.
- Even the notion of “now” does not universally match between observers.

In other words, the “time” we assumed to be obvious is not an absolute entity at all.  
Now, let’s take a further step: What if the belief that “time exists” is itself mistaken?  
Discussions about the beginning of the universe become stuck precisely because they rest on the assumption that time already exists.

But what if:

**Time does not fundamentally exist.**  
**Time is merely a conceptual tool invented by humans to describe the universe.**

If this were true, everything changes.  
The very question “When did the universe begin?” would start to collapse.  
If time does not exist, then “beginning” does not exist.  
“Before” does not exist.  
Even phrases like “how many years have passed” are nothing more than convenient human bookkeeping.

In this chapter, I ask the reader to accept the following foundations:

**A view of the universe that presupposes time is unsuitable for grasping its true origin.**  
**To understand the essence of the universe, we must question the very existence of time itself.**

In the next chapter, we will unravel—from the ground up—the true nature of what we call “time.”
