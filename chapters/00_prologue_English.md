# The Grand Unified Theory Prototype
**Minimal Interrelation Space-timeless Order Network**

A theory that explains matter, forces, space, and the entire universe with a single underlying principle.






# Key Messages

• The universe did not emerge from nothing; it is a “principle that has existed from the outset.”

• Time does not fundamentally exist; what we perceive as time is the update rate of interactions.

• The Big Bang was not the birth of the universe, but a phase transition of the underlying principles themselves.






# Prologue

## Section 1: Background and Motivation

I have loved science—especially physics—ever since I was a child.

Leafing through encyclopedias, I constantly wondered: “What is the world made of?” “Why did the universe begin?” “Does time truly exist?” In university I studied physics and encountered quantum mechanics in a statistics lab. Although I did not continue to graduate school, the structural thinking I gained from physics naturally led me into the IT world. Today I work with AI at a U.S.-based tech company, yet every night I still find myself contemplating the origins of the universe.

As I continued thinking over the years, a conceptual framework gradually formed—one that might serve as the foundation for a unified theory.

I am not a professional physicist, and I have not developed concrete equations. Yet I cannot shake the feeling that this idea touches something essential.

I hope that one day this perspective will reach specialists who can develop it into a rigorous theory. With that hope, I have chosen to make it public.



## Section 2: The Universe and the Nonexistence of Time

My reasoning began with the question of the origin of the universe.

What was the beginning? The Big Bang? And what was before that? Such questioning leads into an infinite regress. To break this loop, we must consider that the universe “has existed from the outset without cause.” If time itself never fundamentally existed, then the very question of a “beginning” becomes meaningless, and the idea of a universe existing from the start becomes non-contradictory.

What, then, is the “time” we perceive? We experience time through physical change—objects move, things decay, systems evolve. At microscopic scales chemical reactions occur; at quantum scales interactions take place. The rate of such change is what constitutes our sense of time.

Is there an upper bound to this rate? Yes—the speed of light. Because light defines the maximum rate of change, what we call “time” is simply our interpretation of ordered changes. Time itself does not fundamentally exist. With this view, the universe existing “without cause” becomes easier to understand.



## Section 3: The Nature of Light and the Unification of Matter, Force, and Space

What is light? Light is not matter but the propagation of pure energy. The speed at which this energy moves has an upper bound: the speed of light. At the Planck scale, energy behaves not as a continuous flow but as discrete updates across minimal relational units. Thus light can be understood as the continuous chain of these energy updates.

Relativity tells us mass and energy are equivalent. Particles may therefore be stable patterns of energy relations. Forces may arise as distortions or resistances within the relational network. Space itself may emerge from the geometry of this network. In this sense, matter, forces, and space are not separate—they are differences in patterns within the smallest energy relations.



## Section 4: The True Nature of the Universe

Combining these ideas reveals a picture of the universe as a vast network of minimal correlations, continuously updating under the limit of light speed, maintaining stable order. This order is what we call physical laws. The deeper structure generating these laws—the fundamental principles—is the true nature of the universe, rather than space-time as a container.

Do these principles themselves have a beginning? Consider concepts like zero or the relation 1+1=2: they do not have origins. They are not created within time; they simply exist. Likewise, the fundamental principles underlying the universe need not have a beginning. From this perspective, a universe without an origin is natural.

Are these principles immutable? I think not. Under extreme conditions they may undergo phase transitions that rewrite the very rules. The Big Bang may be the remnant of such a transition. Black holes may be places where these principles are rewritten, giving rise to different rules and forms of order.

Taken together, I call this worldview the Minimal Interrelation Space-timeless Order Network (MISON).
